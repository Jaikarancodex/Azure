# 💥  Azure Storage Services

Azure Storage provides scalable, durable, secure cloud storage for apps and data.  
This document covers:

- **4.1 Blob Storage**
- **4.2 Storage Tiers & Replication**
- **4.3 Access Control & Shared Access Signatures (SAS)**

---

## 4.1 Blob Storage

Blob = **Binary Large Object** → used for storing unstructured data.

### 🔹 What can you store?
- Images, videos, PDFs
- Application logs
- Backups
- Website static content

### ⚡ Blob Storage Types
| Blob Type | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Block Blob** | General files (images, videos, docs). Most common. |
| **Append Blob** | Optimized for logs where data is appended. |
| **Page Blob** | Used for **Azure VM disks**. |

### 🔹 Storage Structure
 
- **Storage Account** = parent container  
- **Container** = folder  
- **Blob** = actual file  

---

## ✔ 4.2 Storage Tiers & Replication

### 🔹 A. Storage Tiers (Performance + Cost Levels)

Azure offers three tiers based on how often you access data:

| Tier | When to Use | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Hot Tier** | Frequently accessed data | Higher storage cost, low access cost |
| **Cool Tier** | Infrequently accessed (≥ 30 days) | Lower storage cost |
| **Archive Tier** | Rarely accessed (≥ 180 days) | Lowest storage cost, highest access cost |

---

### 🔹 B. Replication (Data Protection & Durability)

Replication determines how many **copies** of your data exist and **where** they are stored.

| Replication Type | Meaning | No. of Copies | Location |
|------------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **LRS** (Locally Redundant Storage) | 3 copies in **one** datacenter | 3 | 1 AZ |
| **ZRS** (Zone Redundant Storage) | Copies across **three AZs** | 3 | Same region |
| **GRS** (Geo‑Redundant Storage) | LRS + copy to secondary region | 6 | Two regions |
| **GZRS** (Geo‑Zone Redundant Storage) | ZRS + geo copy | 6 | Multi‑AZ + DR region |

### 🔹 Replication Summary
- **LRS** → Cheapest, single data center  
- **ZRS** → Protects against AZ failure  
- **GRS** → Protects against regional disaster  
- **GZRS** → Highest durability + geo + zone redundancy  

---

## ✔ 4.3 Access Control & SAS (Shared Access Signatures)

### 🔹A. Access Control Options

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Controls **who** can access the storage account at the Azure level.

Common roles:
- Storage Blob Reader  
- Storage Blob Contributor  
- Storage Blob Owner  

#### 2. ACLs (Access Control Lists)
Set permissions on:
- Containers
- Directories
- Specific blobs  

Useful for granular permissions.

---

### 🔹 B. SAS — Shared Access Signature

SAS = **Temporary secure link** that grants limited access to storage resources **without exposing account keys**.

### 🔹 SAS lets you control:
- **What** → read, write, delete, list  
- **Where** → specific blob or container  
- **When** → expiry times  
- **How** → IP restrictions, HTTPS only  

### 🔹 Types of SAS:
| SAS Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **User Delegation SAS** | Generated with Azure AD identity (most secure) |
| **Service SAS** | Access to specific storage service (Blob/File/Queue/Table) |
| **Account SAS** | Broad access across services in an account |

### 🔹  Example Use Case
You want to allow a client to download a file for **1 hour**:
1. Generate a **read‑only SAS URL**  
2. Send it  
3. Access expires automatically  

---

##  ✔  Quick Revision Summary

- **Blob Storage** stores unstructured data (block, append, page).  
- **Tiers:** Hot → Cool → Archive (cost decreases, latency increases).  
- **Replication:** LRS < ZRS < GRS < GZRS (in durability).  
- **SAS:** Gives temporary, restricted access without sharing account keys.
