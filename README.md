# 💥  Azure Storage Services

Azure Storage provides scalable, durable, secure cloud storage for apps and data.  
This document covers:

- **4.1 Blob Storage**
- **4.2 Storage Tiers & Replication**
- **4.3 Access Control & Shared Access Signatures (SAS)**

---

## 4.1 Blob Storage

Blob = **Binary Large Object** → used for storing unstructured data.

### 🔹 What can you store?
- Images, videos, PDFs
- Application logs
- Backups
- Website static content

### ⚡ Blob Storage Types
| Blob Type | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Block Blob** | General files (images, videos, docs). Most common. |
| **Append Blob** | Optimized for logs where data is appended. |
| **Page Blob** | Used for **Azure VM disks**. |

### 🔹 Storage Structure
 
- **Storage Account** = parent container  
- **Container** = folder  
- **Blob** = actual file  

---

## ✔ 4.2 Storage Tiers & Replication

### 🔹 A. Storage Tiers (Performance + Cost Levels)

Azure offers three tiers based on how often you access data:

| Tier | When to Use | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Hot Tier** | Frequently accessed data | Higher storage cost, low access cost |
| **Cool Tier** | Infrequently accessed (≥ 30 days) | Lower storage cost |
| **Archive Tier** | Rarely accessed (≥ 180 days) | Lowest storage cost, highest access cost |

---

#### And One more tier
<img width="1918" height="622" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4e0117-cd57-4950-b1cd-fbd119c20e55" />


### 🔹 B. Replication (Data Protection & Durability)

Replication determines how many **copies** of your data exist and **where** they are stored.

| Replication Type | Meaning | No. of Copies | Location |
|------------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **LRS** (Locally Redundant Storage) | 3 copies in **one** datacenter | 3 | 1 AZ |
| **ZRS** (Zone Redundant Storage) | Copies across **three AZs** | 3 | Same region |
| **GRS** (Geo‑Redundant Storage) | LRS + copy to secondary region | 6 | Two regions |
| **GZRS** (Geo‑Zone Redundant Storage) | ZRS + geo copy | 6 | Multi‑AZ + DR region |

### 🔹 Replication Summary
- **LRS** → Cheapest, single data center  
- **ZRS** → Protects against AZ failure  
- **GRS** → Protects against regional disaster  
- **GZRS** → Highest durability + geo + zone redundancy  

---

## ✔ 4.3 Access Control & SAS (Shared Access Signatures)

### 🔹A. Access Control Options

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Controls **who** can access the storage account at the Azure level.

Common roles:
- Storage Blob Reader  
- Storage Blob Contributor  
- Storage Blob Owner  

#### 2. ACLs (Access Control Lists)
Set permissions on:
- Containers
- Directories
- Specific blobs  

Useful for granular permissions.

---

### 🔹 B. SAS — Shared Access Signature

SAS = **Temporary secure link** that grants limited access to storage resources **without exposing account keys**.

### 🔹 SAS lets you control:
- **What** → read, write, delete, list  
- **Where** → specific blob or container  
- **When** → expiry times  
- **How** → IP restrictions, HTTPS only  

### 🔹 Types of SAS:
| SAS Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **User Delegation SAS** | Generated with Azure AD identity (most secure) |
| **Service SAS** | Access to specific storage service (Blob/File/Queue/Table) |
| **Account SAS** | Broad access across services in an account |

### 🔹  Example Use Case
You want to allow a client to download a file for **1 hour**:
1. Generate a **read‑only SAS URL**  
2. Send it  
3. Access expires automatically  

---

##  ✔  Quick Revision Summary

- **Blob Storage** stores unstructured data (block, append, page).  
- **Tiers:** Hot → Cool → Archive (cost decreases, latency increases).  
- **Replication:** LRS < ZRS < GRS < GZRS (in durability).  
- **SAS:** Gives temporary, restricted access without sharing account keys.

---

- **Key Vault** → securely store secrets used by both  

### 🔹 Example Flow
A Logic App triggers → calls Azure Function → Function retrieves a secret from Key Vault.

---

# 💥 Azure Data Factory (ADF)

ADF = Azure’s **ETL / ELT orchestration service**.
It **moves**, **copies**, and **transforms** data between systems.

Think of it like **Databricks Workflows + Copy tool + Orchestrator** in one place.

## ✔ **6.1.1 Data Ingestion & Transformation – What Actually Happens**

### 🔹 ** Data Ingestion (Copying Data)**

ADF ingests data from:

* On-prem SQL Server
* Azure SQL
* Blob Storage
* Data Lake
* SaaS apps (Salesforce, Dynamics)
* REST APIs
* File shares, SFTP

The main tool used here is **Copy Activity**.

It reads from **Source** → writes to **Sink (destination)**.

### 🔹 Example

Copy data from **SQL Server** to **Azure Data Lake** every 1 hour.

* Source: On-prem SQL
* Sink: ADLS Gen2
* Integration Runtime handles connectivity

---

### ** 🔹 Data Transformation Options in ADF**

ADF itself is NOT a compute engine (except Data Flows).
It triggers external compute like:

| Tool                            | When used                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mapping Data Flow**           | Drag-and-drop transformations (joins, filters, derived columns) |
| **Databricks Notebook**         | Big data transforms using Spark                                 |
| **Azure SQL Stored Procedures** | Small transformations in SQL                                    |
| **Azure Functions**             | Custom logic                                                    |
| **HDInsight / Synapse**         | Big analytics workloads                                         |

---

### 🔹  Simple Example

You want to clean sales data:

* Read raw CSV
* Filter invalid rows
* Add new calculated columns
* Write cleaned data to ADLS

→ Use **Mapping Data Flow** or trigger a **Databricks notebook**.

---

## ✔ **6.1.2 Pipelines & Activities – Backbone of ADF**

### 🔹 What is a Pipeline?

Pipeline = **container for your workflow**.
A pipeline holds a sequence of steps (activities) to run.

Think of it like:
📦 *A folder that contains all tasks to move or transform your data.*

---

### 🔹 What is an Activity?

Activity = **one task** inside a pipeline.

### 🔹 Types of Activities

| Category                | Examples                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data movement**       | Copy Activity                          |
| **Data transformation** | Mapping Data Flow, Databricks Notebook |
| **Control**             | If, ForEach, Wait, Switch              |
| **External compute**    | Azure SQL, Synapse, HDInsight          |
| **General**             | Web activity, Lookup                   |

---

### 🔹 Example of a Pipeline

Pipeline: **Daily Sales ETL**

Activities inside the pipeline:
* 1️⃣ Lookup activity → Fetch date range
* 2️⃣ Copy activity → Move raw data to ADLS
* 3️⃣ Data Flow activity → Clean & transform data
* 4️⃣ Notebook activity → Run advanced logic
* 5️⃣ Email/Webhook → Send success notification

Pipeline executes everything in sequence or parallel.

---

### 🔹 How triggers work

Triggers start pipelines automatically:

| Trigger              | When used                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Schedule Trigger** | every x mins/hours/days            |
| **Event Trigger**    | when a new file arrives in storage |
| **Manual Trigger**   | run on demand                      |

Example:
"Run pipeline at 2 AM daily" → Schedule Trigger.

---

## ✔ **6.2 Azure SQL Database – Simple & Clear**

Azure SQL Database = **fully managed relational database** in Azure.
It is the cloud version of Microsoft SQL Server.

#### 🔹 Key features

* No need to manage hardware or OS
* Auto backups
* Automatic patching
* Geo-replication for DR

Azure SQL Database stores these tables.
ADF then loads cleaned data from SQL into ADLS for analytics.

---

### ⚡ Quick Summary

* **ADF = ETL orchestration tool**
* **Pipelines = workflow**
* **Activities = tasks inside pipeline**
* **Copy Activity = ingestion**
* **Data Flow / Databricks = transformation**
* **Azure SQL Database = managed SQL Server in cloud**
